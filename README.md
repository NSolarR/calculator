# What is this project?
    This is a project through the Odin Project curriculum.
    The goal of it is to create a fully functional
    calculator website.

# Pre project thoughts:
    I'm a little worried at how this is going to go.
    Mainly I'm unsure at how the calculator logic is going
    to work keeping track of the last number entered and the
    second last number entered.
    It'll probably take me a while to properly work out the
    logic.

    This time around I also intend on making full
    use of css grid for the calculator layout. I need
    to get more acquainted with grid because it's
    etremely useful for site layout. Should make
    the calculator a lot easier to construct
    visually if I use grid right.

# Post project thoughts:
    Very happy with the way this project turned out. Took
    me a while to figure out how to implement all the logic
    behind the calculator. Like how to store all the values
    and then use those to perform calculations. I 
    figured out all the logic on my own without
    googling at all so I'm very happy with how this turned
    out.

    I also got a lot more comfortable using grid and I
    quite like it now. It made the visuals of the calculator
    very easy to set up.

    In the future I think I'm going to try adopting a mobile
    first attitude because it seems rough designing for mobile
    at the end instead of the beginning.
