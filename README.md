# What is this project?
    This is a project through the Odin Project curriculum.
    The goal of it is to create a fully functional
    calculator website.

# Pre project thoughts:
    I'm a little worried at how this is going to go.
    Mainly I'm unsure at how the calculator logic is going
    to work keeping track of the last number entered and the
    second last number entered.
    It'll probably take me a while to properly work out the
    logic.

    This time around I also intend on making full
    use of css grid for the calculator layout. I need
    to get more acquainted with grid because it's
    etremely useful for site layout. Should make
    the calculator a lot easier to construct
    visually if I use grid right.
